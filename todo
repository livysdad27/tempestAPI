Priorities to work....

1.  Get testing setup
    a.  Utilize the local weewx installation for now and drop the driver in the correct directory.
    b.  Setup a script to test it perhaps?
2.  Start with pulling in driver config from the stanza.  Can I do that without having the driver set???
    a.  Get the URI in there as a default value
    b.  Get the station ID, device ID and API key in there.
3.  Narrow the whole mess down to wind for now.  
    a.  Implement the three required sub-classes.
    b.  Make sure they run.
    c.  Make sure loop packets are happening.
4.  Once working get the packaging setup.
5.  Setup a build/automate process so that maintenance/new versions etc... doesn't suck.

Stretch Goals
A.  Implement archive packets based on the summary data.
B.  Pull in device/station ID via rest API call.
C.  Can I get additional archive packets via the rest API call?  Hmmmmm.
